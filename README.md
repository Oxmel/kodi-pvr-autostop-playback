### Description

I originally wrote this script to create an option that wasn't present in the
older Kodi releases (v16 "Jarvis" for instance). The goal was to automatically
stop playback if the TV was turned off to mimic a standard TV behavior when
using Kodi as a PVR/DVR client.

But this is not relevant anymore as the last releases of Kodi now offer the
exact same option through libCEC.

### Use cases

You can recycle this script and adapt it for your own needs. Especially if you
want to trigger custom actions that are not yet implemented by Kodi.

For example, when the TV is turned off, you may want to perform a different
action depending on the player type (music, video, live tv,...). And decide to
stop playback in one case, but not the other. Or to verify if there is no live
recording before stopping the player.
